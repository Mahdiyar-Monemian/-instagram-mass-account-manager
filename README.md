# Instagram Account Management System

A sophisticated, automated system built for a client to manage the mass creation and warming of Instagram accounts at scale. This project integrated browser automation with Telegram's API to handle SMS verification and bypass initial bot detection protocols.

> **Note:** This project is from 2019 and is no longer maintained due to frequent changes in Instagram's API and security policies. It serves as a demonstration of complex automation and system integration.
